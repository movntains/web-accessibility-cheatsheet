# Web Accessibility Foundations

> Bolting on accessibility to a finished product is like shoving chocolate chips into a muffin after it's baked. - Marcy Sutton

What exactly is web accessibility and why does it matter? These are key things to know when it comes to understanding why building accessible websites is so important.

## Digital Accessibility

> Digital accessibility refers to the practice of preventing and removing barriers that keep disabled people from accessing, reading, or writing digital content and interacting with online features.

In simple terms, accessibility is:

- A **civil right** to participate in digital society
- The **inclusion** of people with disabilities
- A key part of design
- Also applicable to the built environment
- Often forgotten
- Necessary to prioritize

Only so much can be fixed with code, so accessibility should also be considered in terms of design, user experience, and all other parts of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that *precede* the actual writing of code.

> Inaccessibility is discrimination in practice, whether intentional or not. If accessibility is marginalized, it creates a self-perpetuating culture of discrimination.

### Business Benefits of Accessibility

If a business ensures that its websites and/or software products are accessible, it can:

- Increase its customer base to include people with disabilities
- Hire people with disabilities
- Create more robust products and services
- Avoid lawsuits
- Minimize costly redesigns and rework
- Highlight access in marketing materials
- Work in government and educational sectors, where accessibility is legally required

### Societal Benefits of Accessibility

Accessibility, both digital and otherwise, will benefit society as a whole by:

- Providing a better quality of life for all
  - **Examples**: curb cuts, elevators, plain language, and intuitive user interfaces
- Reducing social isolation and improving mental health for people with disabilities
- Creating opportunities for everyone
- Creating economic benefits
  - **Examples**: education, GDP and worker productivity, retail, tourism

## Why Web Accessibility Is Important

There are many reasons why web accessibility is important, and they can generally be categorized into the following areas:

- Moral reasons
- Business reasons
- Legal reasons

### Moral Reasons

> Simply put, from a moral standpoint, accessibility is necessary and the right thing to do.

If a website is inaccessible, people with disabilities will have difficulty with the following:

- Accessing a website
- Performing actions independently and securely (e.g., online banking)
- Participating in society in an increasingly digital world
- Making valuable contributions in the workplace

### Business Reasons

Here are some statistics that illustrate how important web accessibility can be from a business perspective:

- [At least 1.3 billion people (16% of the world's population) have a recognized disability](https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1)
- [People with disabilities control $13 trillion in spending](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/12/driving-disability-inclusion-is-more-than-a-moral-imperative-it-s-a-business-one/#:~:text=The%20spending%20power%20of%20people,businesses%20cannot%20afford%20to%20ignore.)
- [The disposable income for working-age people with disabilities in North America and Europe alone is greater than $2.6 trillion](https://www.rod-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Global-Economics-of-Disability-2024-The-Return-on-Disability-Group-September-24-2024.pdf?https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rod-group.com%2Fresearch-insights%2Fannual-report-2024%2F)
- [8,800 ADA-related lawsuits were filed in 2024, which is a 7% increase from 2023](https://www.adatitleiii.com/2025/03/ada-title-iii-federal-lawsuit-numbers-rebound-to-8800-in-2024/#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20plaintiffs%20filed%208%2C800,decisions%20from%20NY%20federal%20judges.)

### Legal Reasons

Different countries and regions have laws that cover accessibility, digital or otherwise.

#### United States

The United States has the following:

- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
- Section 508 (necessary for government websites)
- Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA)
- Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA)

It's worth noting that conforming to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is not required under the ADA. However, WCAG is still the standard by which the accessibility of a website is measured.

#### Canada

Canada has the following:

- Accessible Canada Act
- Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)

#### European Union

The European Union has the following:

- European Policy Act
- EU Directive EN 301 549

## Language and Definitions of Accessibility

Now that we know what accessibility is and why it matters, let's look at some definitions of some common terms in the accessibility space.

### Accessibility APIs

> Accessibility APIs represent objects in a user interface, exposing information about each object through the operating system platform and web browser.

They differ between devices and platforms.

The Smashing Magazine article [Accessibility APIs: A Key to Web Accessibility](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/web-accessibility-with-accessibility-api/) is great for further reading on this topic.

### Assistive Technology (AT)

> An assistive technology (AT) is hardware and/or software that provides functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents.

Some examples of ATs are the following:

- Screen readers
- Braille displays
- Magnifiers
- Text-to-speech
- Speech recognition
- Alternate keyboards (e.g., switches, sip and puff)

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

> The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (WCAG) are part of a series of web accessibility guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the W3C.

These guidelines are grouped into 4 categories:

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

They're invoked by many laws around the world as a standard to follow.

### Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)

> [Accessible Rich Internet Applications](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/) (ARIA) is a specification that comes from the Web Accessibility Initiative of the W3C that includes a standard set of roles, states, and properties that provide accessibility information in websites and web apps.

It's also known as WAI-ARIA.
